# ðŸ”„ Syncing Your App Data to Power BI

## The Problem
Your Power BI was showing sample data instead of your actual app data because the API server wasn't connected to your app's localStorage.

## âœ… Solution Implemented

I've updated the API server to read from the same localStorage keys your app uses:

- `occurrences` - Your occurrence reports  
- `incidents` - Incident data
- `risks` - Risk assessments
- `compliance` - Compliance items

## ðŸš€ How to Sync Your Data

### Method 1: Manual Export (Quick Test)

1. **Open your main app** in browser (`npm run dev`)
2. **Open browser developer tools** (F12)
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Copy and paste this code:**

```javascript
function exportLocalStorageToAPI() {
  const data = {};
  const keys = ['occurrences', 'incidents', 'risks', 'compliance'];
  
  keys.forEach(key => {
    const value = localStorage.getItem(key);
    if (value) {
      data[key] = value;
    }
  });
  
  console.log('Your app data:', JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
  return data;
}

exportLocalStorageToAPI();
```

5. **Copy the output** and save as `localStorage.json` in your `api-server` folder

### Method 2: Real-time Sync (Recommended)

For live data sync, I can help you:

1. **Connect to a real database** (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
2. **Set up automatic sync** between your app and API
3. **Deploy both to Azure** for production use

## ðŸ”§ Updated API Endpoints

Your API now serves real data from your app:

- `GET /api/occurrences` - Your actual occurrence reports âœ…
- `GET /api/incidents` - Your incident data âœ…  
- `GET /api/risks` - Your risk assessments âœ…
- `GET /api/compliance` - Your compliance items âœ…

## ðŸ“Š Refresh Power BI

1. **Restart your API server** if running
2. **Refresh your Power BI connection**
3. **You should now see your actual app data** instead of sample data

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. Test the updated API with your real data
2. Refresh Power BI to see actual occurrences
3. Set up automatic data sync for production use
