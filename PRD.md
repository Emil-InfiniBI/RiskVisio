## Design Direction
The interface should feel authoritative and trustworthy, similar to enterprise software used in regulated industries, with a clean, data-focused approach that emphasizes clarity and quick access to critical information over visual flourishes.

## Color Selection
Complementary (opposite colors) - Using a professional blue and orange palette to create clear visual hierarchy between different types of data while maintaining corporate credibility.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Corporate Blue (oklch(0.45 0.12 240)) - Communicates trust, stability, and professionalism essential for risk management
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays (oklch(0.85 0 0), oklch(0.65 0 0)) for supporting information and backgrounds
- **Accent Color**: Alert Orange (oklch(0.65 0.15 45)) - High visibility for urgent items, warnings, and critical actions
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark text (oklch(0.2 0 0)) - Ratio 16:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray oklch(0.98 0 0)): Dark text (oklch(0.2 0 0)) - Ratio 15:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.45 0.12 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 9.2:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Medium Gray oklch(0.65 0 0)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.7:1 ✓
  - Accent (Alert Orange oklch(0.65 0.15 45)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should convey reliability and precision, using a clean sans-serif that ensures excellent readability in data-dense interfaces and maintains professionalism across all content types.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Titles): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal letter spacing
  - H3 (Subsection): Inter Medium/20px/normal letter spacing
  - Body (Forms/Content): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Labels: Inter Medium/14px/normal letter spacing
  - Captions: Inter Regular/12px/loose letter spacing

## Animations
Subtle and purposeful animations that enhance usability without distracting from critical safety and compliance data, focusing on smooth transitions and clear state changes rather than decorative effects.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates data relationships, system status changes, and guides attention to critical alerts or required actions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Priority alerts and critical incidents receive prominent animation attention, while routine data updates use minimal, professional transitions

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Card layouts for incident/risk summaries, Tables for data lists, Dialogs for detailed forms, Badges for status indicators, Progress bars for investigation status, Tabs for different data views, Select dropdowns for categorization, Date pickers for timeline management
